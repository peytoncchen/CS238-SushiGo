Here is how I like to include Jupyter notebooks in a LaTeX document with \include{}.

Outline

In the Jupyter Notebook, use the raw option for non-code exposition which contains LaTeX. This is achieved by selecting the cell and then pressing ESC followed by R. The cell might look like this:
This is some text in the notebook which contains LaTeX.  
So we can write $\theta \in (0,1)$ or cite \ref{chapter1}  
from elsewhere in the Latex file.
Your LaTeX can reference whatever you like in the overall LaTeX document.

Use nbconvert to output to markdown first. Suppose your notebook is named test.ipynb. Then use
jupyter nbconvert --to markdown test.ipynb
This code creates test.md which is the intermediate file.

Use Pandoc to convert the markdown into LaTeX, as in
pandoc --listings -f markdown -t latex test.md -o test.tex
This will create test.tex which can then be inserted into your main LaTeX document with \include{test.tex}.
Note: The listings package must be available to your LaTeX installation. Dropping the --listings option works, but produces 
Tex which includes many additional command sequences you may not want in your main Tex file. Add the standalone option 
in order to preview the pdf or the see which command sequences and packages you might want to include in 
your main Latex document:

pandoc --listings -f markdown -t latex test.md -s -o test.tex
pdflatex test.tex
You can then open the pdf test.pdf for a preview.
